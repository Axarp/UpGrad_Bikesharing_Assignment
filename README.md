# BoomBikes Demand Analysis:
## Overview:
This project involves developing a machine learning model to understand and predict the demand for shared bikes in the American market for BoomBikes. The goal is to identify significant factors affecting bike demand and to prepare the company for increased demand post-pandemic.
The dataset includes various factors related to meteorological conditions and people's behavior.
## Feature Engineering:
Processed the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features then Used statistical methods and domain knowledge to identify and select key features influencing bike demand.
## Model Building:
Built a linear regression model to assess the impact of various factors on bike demand, focusing on the most significant variables and Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to ensure the model's accuracy and effectiveness.
## Conclusion:
This model provides BoomBikes with insights into the factors driving bike demand, allowing the company to optimize its services and strategies for post-pandemic recovery. By understanding demand patterns, BoomBikes can enhance its operations, better cater to customer needs, and improve overall business performance.
